# UAT Submission Guide

The Atlas API integration process is straightforward. However, we need to conduct UAT to validate the functionality, just as we do for any other application integration. You need to conduct UAT tests once you have integrated Atlas API with your booking and reservation system. You need to perform two sets of UAT tests â€” one where we test the flow from shopping to ticketing service post-integration and the second set of tests to validate the full integration between Atlas API and your booking and reservation portal.

### Shopping and Ticketing Services Only

Once you have integrated the API we need to test and confirm if the integration was successful. The attached **UAT Shopping and Ticketing Service** template has three test scenarios we need you to submit. The test cases of the journey should include the combination of passenger types, trip types, direct or connecting flights and payment methods mentioned in the UAT template.&#x20;

Please download the UAT template below, follow the steps, fill in the test results and submit the test results by email.&#x20;

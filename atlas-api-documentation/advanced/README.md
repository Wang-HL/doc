Your customers have an option to make changes or cancel their booking once they have booked the tickets. They can also opt to buy ancillary services at the time of booking their ticket or post-booking their flight with you. Let’s walk you through the process to integrate the following features: &#x20;

* Adding ancillaries &#x20;
* Cancelling or refunding an order &#x20;
* Adding webhooks to receive automated notifications &#x20;

Please note that not all airlines would offer these services. &#x20;

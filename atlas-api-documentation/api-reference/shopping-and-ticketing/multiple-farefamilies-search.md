# Search

### Dependency

No preceding function needs to be called before `Search`, if you want to return all flights and all farefamilies prices at once.

The search function can be called prior to this call, if you want to first obtain the lowest price for all flights at once, and then specify flights to return the prices for farefamilies.

### Endpoint {% debug uid="search_1.0" %}{% enddebug %}

# Atlas Fare Comparison Solution

#### **Overview**

We want to help you test the Atlas API and arrive at a decision which you feel most confident about. Manually comparing air fares for a combination of flight routes across carriers can be overwhelming.

There are two ways you can test our flight and fare comparison functionality and get comprehensive fare comparison data.

If you are having trouble using our API for fare comparison or you need more support please contact your Atlas Account Manager and we will resolve any issues ASAP.

#### Solutions

Option 1: Use Atlas flights and fare search tool interface to compare with your own fare data.
